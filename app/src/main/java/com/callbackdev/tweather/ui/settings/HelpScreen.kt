/**
 * `HELP.md` — the third file behind the Settings tab bar (Fase 14d), and the app's
 * answer to "what is a commit?" for someone who does not read `git` for a living.
 *
 * Deliberately a file and not an intro carousel: a definition offered before you
 * have seen the thing it defines does not stick, and a screen shown once cannot be
 * consulted the day the question actually arrives. Developers learn a tool from its
 * `--help`, not from slides — so the explanation lives where it can be re-opened
 * forever, and the first run only points at it (the one-shot hint in the editor).
 *
 * Prose, so fully localized, headings included: the same rule `README.md` follows.
 * The words in `code spans` are the app's own file and key names and stay as they are.
 *
 * **Always wrapped, whatever `settings.config` says** (Fase 22, series-wide). Not an
 * exception to the editor fiction but the most editor-like thing in the app: a real
 * one wraps by language, and `"[markdown]": { "editor.wordWrap": "on" }` is the
 * override half of VS Code carries. The line falls where it does because this file is
 * the only one that is *only* prose — the `README.md` tab keeps following the setting,
 * because its tables are padded to their column widths and wrapping them would take
 * the alignment apart. Here there is nothing to align and paragraphs run past 400
 * characters: panning sideways through a sentence is not reading, and this is the one
 * document addressed to somebody who cannot read the app yet.
