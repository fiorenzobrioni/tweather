/**
 * The transcript of `$ tweather init`, printed instead of pasted (Fase 27).
 *
 * The screen was already a terminal session; it was just a still photograph of one.
 * A shell that has plainly finished before you looked at it is the one thing a
 * shell never is, and the block cursor — the single glyph that says the machine is
 * *at* this character, right now — had nowhere to be.
 *
 * **Two speeds, because a transcript has two authors.** The command line is *typed*
 * ([PromptMsPerChar], a hand at a keyboard); everything under it is *printed*
 * ([PrintMsPerChar], five hundred characters a second, which is a program writing
 * to a tty and not a typewriter). The whole run is under two seconds, and the gap
 * between the two rates is what makes the first line read as somebody's and the
 * rest as the machine's answer.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a fake progress bar.** The series' rule is that the file must
 * not lie, and a spinner counting up to a number the app already holds would be the
 * purest form of that lie: an animation inventing work. What is animated is the
 * *arrival* of text that was going to be there anyway, which is what a terminal
 * does.
 *
 * **This canvas always wraps**, whatever `word_wrap` says — the same override
 * `HELP.md` takes (Fase 22), for a sharper reason: a cursor walking off the right
 * edge is a cursor nobody can see, and a first-run screen cannot ask the reader to
 * drag sideways to find where the machine got to. Only the wrap moves, not
 * `line_numbers`.
 *
 * **Three ways out**, in the order they matter:
 *  - *A tap ends it.* While the transcript prints, the whole canvas is one
 *    invisible target: the first touch lands on the finished screen and not on a
 *    choice, and nobody is made to sit through a second reading.
 *  - *Reduced motion never starts it.* [prefersReducedMotion] reads the switch
 *    Android's "Remove animations" writes, and the screen opens complete and still
 *    — on the first frame, not one frame later, which is where a flash would come
 *    from.
 *  - *A screen reader skips it too*, for a reason of its own: a transcript that
 *    grows one character at a time is a semantics tree changing sixty times a
 *    second, and TalkBack would read the intro to pieces.
 *
 * The latch is a [rememberSaveable]: `> use my position` opens a system dialog, and
 * coming back from it — or from a rotation — to watch the intro type itself again
 * would turn a good first second into an obstacle.
