/**
 * The guard that reads the **sources**, not the resources.
 *
 * `RegisterRuleTest` checks that every note the app declares behaves — but it can
 * only see notes that exist. It cannot see a sentence somebody left as a literal,
 * which is exactly what went wrong three times during Fase 18: a sweep by hand kept
 * anchoring `//` to the start of the string, so `append(",  // every sky.crontab
 * line without its own")` never showed up in it. The committente found one of them
 * by eye, on a screenshot.
 *
 * So the sweep is a test now. It walks the Kotlin sources, finds every string
 * literal that carries a comment marker, and fails on any that reads like a
 * **sentence** — three plain lowercase words in a row, which is what separates
 * `// tap again to confirm` from `// active`, `// gps`, `// CC BY 4.0` and
 * `// 15 | 30 | 60 | 120`.
 *
 * The allowlist below is the written record of what stays English and why. Adding
 * to it should feel like a decision, because it is one.
