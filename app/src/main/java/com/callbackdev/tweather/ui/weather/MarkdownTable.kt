/**
 * Pipe tables formatted the way a developer — or the markdown formatter in their
 * editor — writes them: every column padded to its widest cell so the file reads as
 * a rectangle instead of a ragged pile of pipes. `README.md` is rendered as SOURCE
 * (Fase 10, the GitHub "Code" view), and in a source view an unaligned table is
 * simply badly formatted. Numeric columns get the real markdown right-alignment
 * marker (`---:`), so the padding and the syntax agree on what the column is.
 *
 * Emoji are the whole difficulty. None of the twelve weather emoji exist in
 * JetBrains Mono, so every one of them is drawn from the system emoji font
 * (~1.25em advance against the 0.6em of JetBrains Mono, i.e. about two character
 * cells). Two rules follow, and together they are what makes the columns line up:
 *
 * - a cell is measured on its TEXT only, never on the string that carries the emoji
 *   (`"🌧️".length` is 3 UTF-16 units for a single glyph, and that glyph is not one
 *   character wide anyway);
 * - an emoji always sits at the LEFT edge of its cell, exactly one per cell, so
 *   whatever its real width turns out to be on a given device it is the same
 *   constant on every row: every description starts at the same offset and the
 *   closing pipe still falls in column. (It sat at the right edge until Fase 11d;
 *   leading with the glyph keeps the sky readable even when a long description
 *   clips at the screen edge.) Everything AFTER the glyph inherits its unknown
 *   width, which is why both README tables put their status column last — past
 *   the cell there is nothing left to knock out of column but the closing pipe.
 *
 * [EmojiCells] therefore only decides how much padding the emoji-free header and
 * separator rows get; 2 is what markdown formatters and terminals assume for the
 * same glyphs, and it lands within a pixel of the real advance ratio at 13sp.
 *
 * The alignment lives in the source view alone — a markdown renderer would collapse
 * the padding — which is exactly right for an app that has no preview: it is the
 * same craft as lining up the `=` in a config file.
